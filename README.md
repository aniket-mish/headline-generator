# Text-to-SQL

Writing queries to solve analytical problems is a core task for a lot of data users. The challenge is to find the right data and translate the problem into correct and efficient SQL code. This becomes more difficult when data is spread across different domains. 

I'm trying to build a text-to-sql feature which translates the analytical query into sql code.
